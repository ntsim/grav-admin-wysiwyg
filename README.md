# Admin Wysiwyg Plugin

The **Admin Wysiwyg** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).

## Description

Replaces standard Markdown editor available in Grav's Admin plugin with a WYSIWYG editor.

This is still relatively experimental and is most likely buggy currently. Your mileage may vary.
